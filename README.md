# Countdown

A replication of the countdown animation in the film [Mission to Mars](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mission_to_mars/) made with `three.js` and `tween.js`. 

## Notes

I love the design of this binary timer. The rings appear to be resting on a translucent surface, which gives a wonderful sense of depth as they rotate. I used many layers of transparency beneath the rings to create this effect. 

Also it was challenging to position the camera (perspective) the same as the movie. I had fun referencing the movie and learn't a lot.

**Interesting fact**: having only 7 rings rotating at this speed lasts about a minute, which wasn't long enough for the scene in the movie!
