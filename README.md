### Countdown

A replication of the countdown animation from the film [Mission to Mars](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mission_to_mars/). 

I love the design of this binary timer. The rings appear to be resting on a liquid, which gives a sense of depth when they rotate. I had fun referencing the movie, and I learn't a lot about WebGL.

Interesting fact: having only 7 rings rotating at this speed lasts about a minute, which wasn't long enough for the scene in the movie!
