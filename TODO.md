### Todo List

- code cleanup
- apply a subtle glow effect to the rings, refer: [http://kadekeith.me/stuff/three/glow/](http://kadekeith.me/stuff/three/glow/)
- add sound effects. 
  - sounds for ring animations (sample from movie)
    - they possibly overlap?
    - there is a pattern, one is slightly stronger than the other, eg: "bom, boom, bom, boom"
  - sound for startup animation
- animation for when sequence is complete (something satisfying for watching it...)
